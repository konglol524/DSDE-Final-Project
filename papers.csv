201900000,Identifying nursing research priorities in Vietnam: A modified delphi study†,31/12/2019,"© 2019 2019 Aungsuroch et al., published by Sciendo.There is no single study that has examined nursing research priorities in Vietnam. This study aimed to gain consensus from experts on the nursing research priorities in Vietnam. A three-round modified Delphi study was used in this study. A focus group discussion among experts was conducted in round I to identify the nursing research priorities (n=23). Data in round I were analyzed using content analysis. In round II, participants were invited to rate the importance of each nursing priority topic in a 5-point Likert scale questionnaire, which had a 74% (n=17) response rate. In round III, the questionnaire was returned to the experts (n=17) until consensus was reached. Data from round II and round III were analyzed to produce mean score and final rank. The top 12 research priority lists were identified, which included subthemes and areas of possible investigations. All priorities were classified into three groups in the rank order, namely: (i) nursing management and leadership, which included (1) nursing care quality, (2) management and leadership of nurse managers, (3) nursing image, (4) professional nurse competency, and (5) human resource management; (ii) nursing education, which included (1) knowledge-specific domain, (2) the linkage between education and practice, and (3) nurse teacher workforce; and (iii) nursing service, which included (1) adult nursing concern, (2) patient safety, (3) public health nursing concern, and (4) quality of life of patients and nurses. Consensus among experts was achiever, and the findings are considered as the basis of resources to the most essential research needs in Vietnam.",English,29,5,6504821483,"['6504821483', '57214074165', '57214071549', '56338050100', '33068019000', '57192718324']","['2900', '3304']","['Delphi method', 'nursing', 'research priorities', 'Vietnam']",,"['2900', '3304', 'NURS', 'SOCI']",Chulalongkorn University
201900001,Evaluation of the sciatic nerve location regarding its relationship to the piriformis muscle,30/12/2019,"Copyright © 2020 Via MedicaBackground: The localisation of sciatic nerve (SN) is essential for the achievement of several procedures performed in the gluteal region. This study proposed to investigate the location of SN regarding its relationship to the piriformis (PM) by the line joining the posterior superior iliac spine (PSIS), ischial tuberosity (IT) and greater trochanter (GT). Materials and methods: SN-PM relationship was examined in 204 specimens from 102 embalmed cadavers (55 males, 47 females). Distances between PSIS, IT and GT were measured. Midpoints of SN at the lower edge of PM (S1) and IT-GT line (S2) were marked. Perpendicular line from S1 to PSIS-GT (S1-R) and to PSIS-IT (S1-Q), were created and measured. Distances of PSIS-R, PSIS-Q (S1) and IT-S2 were measured and calculated into percentage of PSIS-GT, PSIS-IT and IT-GT lengths, respectively. Results: Regarding the classification of Beaton and Anson, three types of SN-PM relationship (a, b and c) were obtained. The percentage of type a, b and c was 74.02, 22.55 and 3.43, respectively. Symmetrical SN-PM relationship was found in 75.49%. The mean length of PSIS-IT, PSIS-GT and IT-GT in all types was 129.63 ± 11.89 mm, 151.34 ± 14.78 mm and 73.02 ± 10.20 mm, respectively. A statistically significant difference was found between types a and b (p = 0.013) in PSIS-IT length, whereas mean length of IT-GT and PSIS-GT showed no statistically significant difference between SN-PM types. PSIS-IT line passed SN at the lower edge of PM (S1) in 112 specimens (54.90%). In these cases, S1 and Q were the same point. A statistically significant difference was also found between types a and b (p = 0.023) in PSIS-Q (S1) length. The mean lengths of PSIS-Q (S1), PSIS-R and IT-S2 in term of percentage of PSIS-IT, PSIS-GT and IT-GT line in all types were 60.06 ± 5.90%, 54.19 ± 6.10%, and 37.87 ± 8.27%, respectively. The mean lengths of S1-R and S1-Q were 30.07 ± ± 8.30 mm and 6.54 ± 7.99 mm. Therefore, SN at S1 could be located at the point of 54.19 ± 6.10% of PSIS-GT length (R) with a distance of 30.07 ± 8.30 mm perpendicular to PSIS-GT line (S1-R). Since the PSIS-IT line did not pass SN at S1 in every case, it might not be suitable for localizing SN at S1. SN at S2 could be located at the point of 37.87 ± 8.27% of IT-GT line. No significant difference was found between types. Conclusions: Sciatic nerve can be localised by PSIS-GT and IT-GT lines without statistically significant difference between types (a, b, and c) of SN-PM relationship.",English,34,1,6603477340,"['57220192554', '13609375600', '6602295863', '6603477340']","['2702', '2722']","['Greater trochanter', 'Ischial tuberosity', 'Localisation', 'Piriformis muscle', 'Posterior superior iliac spine', 'Sciatic nerve']","['Buttocks', 'Cadaver', 'Female', 'Femur', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Muscle, Skeletal', 'Sciatic Nerve']","['2702', '2722', 'MEDI']",Chulalongkorn University

201900003,Clinical outcomes and surgical preferences for breast-conserving surgery and mastectomy: A propensity score-matched analysis,30/12/2019,"© 2019 Mawin Vongsaisuwon et al., published by Sciendo.While numerous randomized controlled trials have demonstrated long-term survival rates for patients with early-stage breast cancer treated with breast-conserving surgery (BCS) comparable to mastectomy, the latter remains the most prevalent surgical option to treat early-stage breast cancer in Thailand. To investigate the potential determinants affecting the decision on selecting BCS or mastectomy for the treatment of early-stage breast cancer and to compare the disease-free survival and overall survival between the treatments using a propensity score-matched analysis. Patients diagnosed nonmetastatic breast cancer at the Queen Sirikit Breast Cancer Center from January 2006 to December 2015, were retrospectively identified and grouped intro patients who received BCS or mastectomy. After propensity score matching, 356 BCS and 209 mastectomy patients were identified, and statistical analysis was conducted to determine treatment selection factors and compare disease-free and overall survival. Disease-free survival and overall survival in months comparing BCS and mastectomy were not statistically different with P values of 0.11 and 0.77, respectively. Determinants of treatment selection found that younger age, surgeon preference, smaller tumor size, and lower tumor grade were statistically significant factors in the selection of BCS over mastectomy. The majority of surgeons had a preference for one treatment over the other (P < 0.001). The outcome of BCS is comparable to mastectomy in early-stage breast cancer patients. Key determinants affecting the selection of treatment were identified to be patient age, characteristics of the tumor, and surgeon's preference.",English,16,1,57202704043,"['57202704043', '14720203700', '57214091437']",['1300'],"['breast-conserving surgery', 'mastectomy', 'retrospective study']",,"['1300', 'BIOC']",Faculty of Medicine
201900004,Common orthopedic problems in the neonate: A comparative study of 2 periods at a tertiary-care hospital,30/12/2019,"© 2019 Anongnart Sirisabya, et al., published by Sciendo.In 1975, King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital (KCMH) in Bangkok, Thailand, published data on common orthopedic problems in neonates. To determine the more recent incidence of these conditions and to compare the results with those reported 40 years ago by KCMH. The data were also compared with a recent report from Siriraj Hospital. We reviewed medical records of newborn infants from 2012 to 2016, all of whom were born in KCMH with deformities of upper and lower extremities or other birth-related injuries. The cases were grouped according to International Classification of Diseases, 10th edition. The incidence of common neonatal orthopedic problems was calculated as cases per 1,000 live births and compared, using a chi-squared test, with the earlier data from KCMH and with the data recently reported by Siriraj hospital. Of the 24,825 live births, 54% were male and 46% were female. The average birth weight was 3,052.2 ± 516.1 g (range, 535-5,320 g) for infants. The most common deformity was postural clubfoot, followed by calcaneovalgus and hip dysplasia, with incidences of 1.37, 0.93 and 0.52 per 1,000 live births, respectively. The incidence of calcaneovalgus, metatarsus adductus, and clubfoot was lower than in the 1975 study and in the report from Siriraj. In all 3 studies, the incidence of birth-related injury was similar and clavicular fracture was the most common, with a rate of 1.3/1,000 live births. The incidence of common neonatal orthopedic problems varies among institutions. Birth-related injury is a major challenge. The results may be utilized as updated data and as a starting point for parental education.",English,19,2,24461512000,"['57194266512', '57212304252', '24461512000']",['1300'],"['foot deformities', 'fracture', 'hip dysplasia', 'incidence', 'newborn']",,"['1300', 'BIOC']",Chulalongkorn University
201900005,Conservative surgical management for immediate postpartum hemorrhage,30/12/2019,"© 2019 2019 Puangsricharoen and Manchana, published by Sciendo.Conservative surgical management for postpartum hemorrhage (PPH), such as balloon tamponade, uterine compression suture, and uterine artery ligation, has the benefit of preserving reproductive function. To assess the efficacy and subsequent pregnancy outcome of conservative surgical management for patients with immediate PPH. Medical records of patients who had PPH between January 2011 and December 2016 were reviewed. Conservative surgical management included B-Lynch uterine compression suture, Bakri balloon tamponade, and uterine artery ligation. The treatments were considered successful if patients did not require subsequent hysterectomy. Perioperative complications and subsequent pregnancy outcomes were recorded. Of 30,271 deliveries, 669 patients experienced PPH or 2.2% of total deliveries. Sixty-one patients (9.1%) did not respond to medical treatment with various uterotonic agents. Hysterectomy was selected initially in 30 patients. Conservative surgical management was performed in 31 patients: 15 Bakri balloon tamponade, 13 uterine compression suture, and 3 uterine artery ligation. There were 3 patients who failed Bakri balloon tamponade and proceeded to perform uterine compression suture with successful outcome. The success rates for conservative surgical treatment were 66.7%, 75%, and 66.7%, respectively. All patients who had successful conservative surgical management resumed normal menstruation. Three out of 11 patients (27.3%) who desired subsequent pregnancy were able to conceive and carry out a viable pregnancy. Conservative surgical management has acceptable success rates for controlling intractable immediate PPH. Implementation of such procedures should be done to preserve fertility and decrease maternal morbidity and mortality.",English,22,2,12244640600,"['56784261900', '12244640600']",['1300'],"['balloon occlusion', 'postpartum hemorrhage', 'uterine artery ligation', 'uterine compression suture']",,"['1300', 'BIOC']",Chulalongkorn University and King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital
201900006,Distinguishing magnetic resonance imaging features between idiopathic hypertrophic pachymeningitis and secondary hypertrophic pachymeningitis,30/12/2019,"© 2019 2019 Warittikoon and Jakchairoongruang, published by Sciendo.Hypertrophic pachymeningitis (HP) is a rare chronic inflammatory disorder characterized by marked fibrous thickening of the cerebral and/or spinal dura mater. This condition is caused by infection, inflammation, autoimmune disorder, neoplasms, or idiopathic. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may play an important role in differentiating idiopathic HP from secondary HP, may avoid unnecessarily invasive dural biopsy, and prompt specific treatment. To determine the specific MRI findings for differentiation between idiopathic HP and secondary HP. A total of 34 patients underwent MRI of the brain and cervical spine from January 2003 to December 2015. In all, 23 patients were diagnosed idiopathic HP and 11 patients were secondary HP. Demographic data and imaging findings reveal the following: Configuration, thickness, signal intensity on T1-weighted image (T1WI), T2-weighted image (T2WI), and enhancement pattern of the lesions. The data were analyzed by T-test and Fisher's exact test. Secondary HP were significantly located at anterior and middle cranial fossa (P = 0.033). There is no significant difference of lesions in configurations, T1 and T2 signal intensity and patterns of enhancement. There was significant and exclusive difference in T2 hypointense/dark intensity and homogeneous enhancement in idiopathic HP (75%, P = 0.044). MRI may play a complimentarily important role in distinguishing idiopathic HP from secondary HP. Idiopathic HP is probably preferred diagnosis in the lesions with T2-rim pattern and T2 hypointense/dark intensity with homogeneous enhancement.",English,14,2,57214089969,"['57214089969', '55802946900']",['1300'],"['dural inflammation', 'dural thickening', 'hypertrophic pachymeningitis', 'idiopathic hypertrophic pachymeningitis', 'thickened dura']",,"['1300', 'BIOC']",Thai Red Cross Society
201900007,Transcriptome analysis of Pueraria candollei var. mirifica for gene discovery in the biosyntheses of isoflavones and miroestrol,26/12/2019,"© 2019 The Author(s).Background: Pueraria candollei var. mirifica, a Thai medicinal plant used traditionally as a rejuvenating herb, is known as a rich source of phytoestrogens, including isoflavonoids and the highly estrogenic miroestrol and deoxymiroestrol. Although these active constituents in P. candollei var. mirifica have been known for some time, actual knowledge regarding their biosynthetic genes remains unknown. Results: Miroestrol biosynthesis was reconsidered and the most plausible mechanism starting from the isoflavonoid daidzein was proposed. A de novo transcriptome analysis was conducted using combined P. candollei var. mirifica tissues of young leaves, mature leaves, tuberous cortices, and cortex-excised tubers. A total of 166,923 contigs was assembled for functional annotation using protein databases and as a library for identification of genes that are potentially involved in the biosynthesis of isoflavonoids and miroestrol. Twenty-one differentially expressed genes from four separate libraries were identified as candidates involved in these biosynthetic pathways, and their respective expressions were validated by quantitative real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. Notably, isoflavonoid and miroestrol profiling generated by LC-MS/MS was positively correlated with expression levels of isoflavonoid biosynthetic genes across the four types of tissues. Moreover, we identified R2R3 MYB transcription factors that may be involved in the regulation of isoflavonoid biosynthesis in P. candollei var. mirifica. To confirm the function of a key-isoflavone biosynthetic gene, P. candollei var. mirifica isoflavone synthase identified in our library was transiently co-expressed with an Arabidopsis MYB12 transcription factor (AtMYB12) in Nicotiana benthamiana leaves. Remarkably, the combined expression of these proteins led to the production of the isoflavone genistein. Conclusions: Our results provide compelling evidence regarding the integration of transcriptome and metabolome as a powerful tool for identifying biosynthetic genes and transcription factors possibly involved in the isoflavonoid and miroestrol biosyntheses in P. candollei var. mirifica.",English,56,13,6504468264,"['57212648206', '57212649593', '52364673400', '57202108208', '57195606486', '57212652198', '57216078193', '7402387761', '57205708453', '6602179772', '36464360000', '6504468264']",['1110'],"['Isoflavones', 'Miroestrol', 'Pueraria candollei var. mirifica', 'Transcriptome', 'White Kwao Krua']","['Gene Expression Profiling', 'Genetic Association Studies', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Isoflavones', 'Phytoestrogens', 'Pueraria', 'Steroids', 'Transcriptome']","['1110', 'AGRI']",Chulalongkorn University

This work aims to compare the performance of a monofiber optical probe in characterizing the hydrodynamics in spray systems with that of a high-speed camera. Initially, both techniques determined the same series of droplets produced by a syringe. The droplet velocities and sizes obtained from the optical probe were in accordance with the high-speed camera when the droplet coalescence was filtered out from the data. Second, a full-cone spray nozzle was used and the average velocities from the two techniques were close, but the off-center collision on the probe and the difference in size limits caused the discrepancy in the size determination. However, the probe is still beneficial to determine the droplet hydrodynamics and local liquid fraction, the essential characteristics of a spray system.",English,32,6,8635553300,"['57015238700', '24070415100', '7004329246', '8635553300']","['1600', '1500', '2209']",,"['Average velocity', 'Droplet coalescence', 'Droplet hydrodynamics', 'Droplet velocity', 'Essential characteristic', 'Optical fiber probe', 'Optical probe', 'Spray systems']","['631.1', '741.1.2', '742.2', '902', '1600', '1500', '2209', 'CHEM', 'CENG', 'ENGI']",Chulalongkorn University

The cutting force is proposed to predict the straightness and surface roughness. The Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) is used to prove the relations of them by checking the frequencies of them. The cutting force ratio is proposed and normalized to predict the in-process surface roughness and straightness regardless of the cutting conditions. The surface roughness and the straightness are calculated simultaneously by employing the two-layer feed-forward neural networks with sigmoid hidden and linear output neurons. The neural networks is trained by using the Levenberg-Marquardt back propagation algorithm.

201900010,Bacterial community structures and biodegradation kinetic of Tiamulin antibiotic degrading enriched consortia from swine wastewater,21/12/2019,"© 2019 Springer Nature Switzerland AG.The antibiotic tiamulin (TIA) is common and widely used medication for dysentery eradication in swine productions. Tiamulin persists in livestock manure, and its residues have been found in various environment. This work obtained four tiamulin-degrading enriched bacterial consortia from a covered anaerobic lagoon system and a stabilized pond system of swine farms. Tiamulin was efficiently removed by the enriched cultures at the concentrations between 2.5 and 200 mg/L, with a removal of 60.1-99.9% during 16 h and a degradation half-life of 4.5-15.7 h. The stabilized pond system cultured with taimulin solely could eliminate tiamulin at the highest rates. The logistic substrate degradation model fit most of the experimental data. Next-generation amplicon sequencing was conducted, and it was found that the bacterial community was significantly impacted by the inoculum source, nutrient addition, and high tiamulin concentrations. Principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) indicated the similarity of bacterial communities in the original enriched samples and the 2.5 mg/L tiamulin-removed cultures. The 200 mg/L consortia were rather different and became similar to the other 200 mg/L consortia from different sources and cultures without nutrient supplementation. Shannon and Simpson indices suggested a reduction in bacterial diversity at high concentrations. The microbes that had high growth in the most efficient enriched culture, or which were abundant in all samples, or which increased with higher tiamulin concentrations were likely to be the major tiamulin-degrading bacteria. This is the first report suggested the possible roles of Achromobacter, Delftia, Flavobacterium, Pseudomonas, and Stenotrophomonas in tiamulin degradation.",English,49,6,36239507700,"['57214759461', '6508320959', '36239507700']","['2305', '2402', '2312', '2311', '2310', '2739', '2307']","['Degradation kinetic', 'Enrichment culture', 'Next generation sequencing', 'Swine farm', 'Tiamulin (TIA)', 'Veterinary antibiotic substance']",,"['2305', '2402', '2312', '2311', '2310', '2739', '2307', 'ENVI', 'IMMU', 'MEDI']",Chulalongkorn University

Medical education was an additional responsibility for the clinicians who already had multi-dimensional roles in the healthcare system where there is acute shortage of healthcare professionals. We studied the impact of FDPs on postgraduate medical education in Bhutan. Methods: This was a mixed-methods study with a quantitative (cohort study - quasi-experimental with 18 participants) and concurrent explanatory qualitative component (focused group discussion (FGD) with 11 teaching faculty members). The 18 participants were given a structured FDP designed by the University. The FGD assessed teacher self-efficacy and competency using standard tools before and after the FDP. Thematic analysis of the FGD explored the impact of FDPs in the delivery of postgraduate residency programmes. Results: There were significant increase in the teacher self-efficacy (31 vs 34, p = 0.009) and competency scores (56 vs 64, p = 0.011). There were significant improvements in self-efficacy in the domain of the teaching relevant subject contents and developing creative ways to cope with system constraints. In teaching-learning assessments, there was a significant appreciation of the effectiveness of lectures and tutorials and the use of essay questions. The FGD demonstrated the acceptance of FDPs and its importance in quality improvement of postgraduate medical education, professional development of teachers and improvement of their communication skills. The teachers have now migrated from the conventional methods of teaching to workplace-based teaching and assessment. The FDPs also resulted in review and revision of postgraduate medical curriculum soon after the first batch graduated in 2018. Lack of adequate support from relevant stakeholders and lack of a medical education centre in the University were seen as major challenges. Conclusions: The FDPs have brought tangible professionalization of postgraduate medical education at an early stage of the medical university.

The analysis is based on data collected in 2017 with the CMS detector at the LHC in proton-proton collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 41.1 fb-1. The results of this analysis are combined with those of an earlier analysis based on data collected at the same collision energy in 2016, corresponding to 35.9 fb-1. Signal candidates will be recoiling against initial state radiation and are identified as energetic, large-radius jets with two pronged substructure. The invariant jet mass spectrum is probed for a potential narrow peaking signal over a smoothly falling background. No evidence for such resonances is observed within the mass range of 50-450 GeV. Upper limits at the 95%confidence level are set on the coupling of narrow resonances to quarks, as a function of the resonance mass.

201900016,Pathways to parental anxiety: Effect of coping strategies for disruptive behaviors in children with attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder,19/12/2019,"© 2019 2019 Napakkawat Buathong et al., published by Sciendo.Disruptive behaviors are commonly found in children with attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and affect the mental health of parents. However, a study of the direct and indirect effects between disruptive behaviors in children with ADHD and parental anxiety and coping strategies is apparently lacking. To examine the direct and indirect relationship between disruptive behaviors in children with ADHD and parental anxiety and coping strategies as a mediator. A cross-sectional study was conducted at King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital, Thailand between March 2015 and January 2016. Participants comprised 200 parents whose children were diagnosed with ADHD by physicians. Participants completed questionnaires regarding sociodemographic characteristics including The Thai Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, The Swanson, Nolan and Pelham (SNAP-IV): Parent form (Thai version), and The Coping Scale Questionnaire (Thai version). The direct path between disruptive behaviors and anxiety was significant (b = 0.21, P = 0.002). Moreover, a significant indirect path was found between disruptive behaviors and coping behavior with escape-avoidance (β = 0.20, P = 0.005), and an indirect path was found between escape-avoidance and anxiety (b = 0.31, P <0.001). Health care professionals should evaluate the use of coping strategies by parents of children with ADHD and encourage the parents to use a positive strategy for coping with the disruptive behaviors of their children.",English,26,0,35112818300,"['35112818300', '16043019400', '57211288593']",['1300'],"['attention deficit disorder with hyperactivity', 'disruptive behavior', 'parental anxiety']",,"['1300', 'BIOC']",Chulalongkorn University

201900018,Changes in protein patterns of Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli by silver nanoparticles capped with poly (4-styrenesulfonic acid-co-maleic acid) polymer,19/12/2019,"© 2019 Hathaichanok Tamiyakul et al., published by Sciendo.While silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) are increasingly attractive as an antibacterial agent in many applications, the effect of AgNPs on bacterial protein profiles, especially AgNPs stabilized by polymeric molecules, is not well understood. To investigate the changes in bacterial protein patterns by AgNPs capped with poly (4-styrenesulfonic acid-co-maleic acid) (AgNPs-PSSMA) polymer toward Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923 and Escherichia coli ATCC 25922. The growth of bacteria after incubated with AgNPs-PSSMA for different time intervals was determined by optical density at 600 nm. Their protein patterns were observed using sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), and the proteomic analysis of extracted proteins was determined by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). AgNPs-PSSMA was able to inhibit the growth of both S. aureus and E. coli cells. The treated bacterial cells expressed more proteins than the untreated cells as seen from SDS-PAGE study. Nanosilver (NS) caused the upregulation of metabolic gene, waaA, in S. aureus cells. For E. coli cells, the upregulated proteins were metabolic genes (srlB, fliE, murD) and other genes dealt with DNA replication (dinG), DNA-RNA transcription (yrdD), RNA-protein translation (rplD), molecular transport (sapF), and signal transduction (tdcF). The antibacterial effect of AgNPs-PSSMA may arise by changing the bacterial proteins and thus interfering with the normal cell function.",English,45,7,6507907764,"['57214089489', '6508382189', '54994103400', '55043184500', '6701900430', '6507907764']",['1300'],"['Escherichia coli', 'nanomedicine', 'nanoparticles', 'proteomics', 'Staphylococcus aureus']",,"['1300', 'BIOC']",Chulalongkorn University
201900019,Survival outcomes of low-risk and intermediate-risk stage ib1 cervical cancer patients,19/12/2019,"© 2019 Asama Vanichtantikul et al., published by Sciendo.Survival for patients with early stage cervical cancer without any high-risk factors treated with radical hysterectomy is excellent. However, there are few data on the survival outcomes for low-risk and intermediate-risk early stage cervical cancer patients. To determine survival outcomes and prognostic factors of low-risk and intermediate-risk stage IB1 cervical cancer patients. Stage IB1 cervical cancer patients with radical hysterectomy and pelvic lymphadenectomy were retrospectively reviewed. Patients with positive pelvic nodes, parametrial involvement, and positive margin who are classified as high-risk patients were excluded. Patients with squamous cell carcinoma or grade 1-2 adenocarcinoma, tumor size less than 2 cm, no lymphovascular space invasion (LVSI), and depth of stromal invasion (DSI) less than 10 mm were defined as low-risk patients. Survival was evaluated using the Kaplan-Meier method and compared by the log-rank test. Multivariate analysis was performed using Cox proportional-hazards regression. There were 82 (42.3%) low-risk patients and 112 (57.7%) intermediate-risk patients. More patients in intermediate risk received adjuvant treatment (3.6% and 14.3%, P = 0.07). Three (3.6%) low-risk patients and 18 (16.1%) intermediate-risk patients had recurrent disease (P = 0.004). At median follow-up of 86 months, 1.2% of low-risk patients and 8.9% of intermediate-risk had cancer-related deaths (P = 0.02). Low-risk patients had significantly better 5-year disease-free survival (98.2% vs 91.1%, P = 0.01) and estimated 5-year overall survival (98.5% vs 91.1%, P = 0.01). DSI more than 10 mm and presence of LVSI were significantly associated with recurrence. However, LVSI was an independent prognostic factor. Stage IB1 cervical cancer patients had excellent survival. Low-risk patients had significantly better survival.

201900022,Binder-free centimeter-long V2O5nanofibers on carbon cloth as cathode material for zinc-ion batteries,19/12/2019,"© 2019 MDPI AG. All rights reserved.Recently, rechargeable aqueous zinc-ion batteries (AZBs) have attracted extensive interest due to their safety, abundance, low cost, and low toxicity. However, aqueous electrolytes require a polymeric binder to prevent dissolution of the active material in addition to its binding properties. This study highlights binder-free, centimeter long, single-crystal, V2O5 nanofibers (BCS-VONF) on carbon cloth, as the cathode material for AZBs synthesized via a simple one-step hydrothermal process. BCS-VONF in 3.0 M Zn(OTf)2 exhibit promising electrochemical performance with excellent capacity retention. Even in the absence of a binder, BCS-VONF were found to be very stable in 3.0 M Zn(OTf)2. They will not yield to the dissolution and detachment of the active material on the current collector. The novel strategy described in this study is an essential step for the development of BCS-VONF on carbon cloth, as a promising cathode material for AZBs.",English,41,31,57203906041,"['57212549757', '55656414300', '22636203800', '56502906400', '55139045700', '57203906041', '55897360400']","['2105', '2103', '2102', '2101', '2606', '2208']","['Aqueous electrolyte', 'Binder free', 'Carbon cloth', 'Nanofiber', 'Vanadium oxide', 'Zinc trifluoromethanesulfonate', 'Zinc-ion battery']","['Aqueous electrolyte', 'Binder free', 'Carbon cloths', 'Trifluoromethanesulfonate', 'Vanadium oxides', 'Zinc ions']","['546.3', '702', '702.1.2', '761', '801.4', '802.3', '803', '804', '933', '933.1', '78.23', '2105', '2103', '2102', '2101', '2606', '2208', 'ENER', 'MATH', 'ENGI']",Hunan University
201900023,"A double masked randomised 4-week, placebo-controlled study in the USA, Thailand and Taiwan to compare the efficacy of oral valganciclovir and topical 2% ganciclovir in the treatment of cytomegalovirus anterior uveitis: Study protocol",19/12/2019,"© © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019. Re-use permitted under CC BY-NC. No commercial re-use. See rights and permissions. Published by BMJ.Introduction Cytomegalovirus (CMV) anterior uveitis is a recognised cause of anterior uveitis in immunocompetent patients and is preventable cause of vision loss. Ocular sequelae include corneal endothelial damage which can cause corneal oedema and failure, as well as glaucoma. Recurrences of inflammation are common and therefore patients are often exposed to long-term therapy. Oral therapy is available in the form of valganciclovir, although with the caveat of systemic side effects such as bone marrow suppression and renal failure necessitating regular interval laboratory monitoring. Recent reports have demonstrated that topical 2% ganciclovir solution may offer promising treatment outcomes in patients with CMV anterior uveitis with superior safety, cost-effectiveness and convenience profiles. An investigation into the relative equipoise of these therapies is warranted for these reasons. Methods and analysis The Systemic and Topical Control of Cytomegalovirus Anterior uveitis: Treatment Outcomes (STACCATO) trial is designed as a multicentre, block randomised by site, double-masked, placebo-controlled trial comparing the efficacy of oral valganciclovir, 2% topical ganciclovir and placebo in treating PCR-proven CMV anterior uveitis. Participant clinical evaluation will occur at three study time points by a masked study ophthalmologist over a 28-day period to assess resolution of ocular inflammation (secondary outcome). A control group will provide additional information about the possible impact that the infected host's immune response may play in controlling local viral replication. The primary analysis is an analysis of covariance (three arms) correcting for baseline to compare quantitative CMV viral load in the anterior chamber (AC) aqueous fluid before and 7 days after treatment.

201900024,Probing the chiral magnetic wave in pPb and PbPb collisions at √SNN = 5.02 TeV using charge-dependent azimuthal anisotropies,18/12/2019,"© 2019 CERN, for the CMS Collaboration.Charge-dependent anisotropy Fourier coefficients (νn) of particle azimuthal distributions are measured in pPb and PbPb collisions at √SNN = 5.02 TeV with the CMS detector at the LHC. The normalized difference in the second-order anisotropy coefficients (ν2) between positively and negatively charged particles is found to depend linearly on the observed event charge asymmetry with comparable slopes for both pPb and PbPb collisions over a wide range of charged particle multiplicity. In PbPb, the third-order anisotropy coefficient ν3 shows a similar linear dependence with the same slope as seen for ν2. The observed similarities between the ν2 slopes for pPb and PbPb, as well as the similar slopes for ν2 and ν3 in PbPb, are compatible with expectations based on local charge conservation in the decay of clusters or resonances, and constitute a challenge to the hypothesis that, at LHC energies, the observed charge asymmetry dependence of ν2 in heavy ion collisions arises from a chiral magnetic

201900025,Asiaticoside but not its aglycone exhibits neuritogenicity through TrkA receptor signaling: A bridge between ERK1/2-CREB and Akt-GSK3β/RhoA,18/12/2019,"© 2019 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins. All rights reserved.The neuritogenicity and the neuroregenerative potential of asiaticoside (AS) and its aglycone, asiatic acid (AA), has been generally reported. We recently identified the participation of extracellular signal-regulated protein kinases 1/2 (ERK1/2) and protein kinase B (Akt) in the neuritogenic mechanism of AS and AA. In this study, we further investigated the possible upstream target molecule and the associated downstream signaling of both triterpenoids in mouse neuroblastoma Neuro-2a cells. Our immunoblotting and immunofluorescence assays revealed that either AS or AA exerted neurite extension activity through inhibitory effect on glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β) and Ras homolog gene family member A (RhoA). AS appeared significantly more potent in promoting neurite elongation than AA, and concurrently expressed a higher degree of inhibition on GSK3β and RhoA activations. The mediation of GSK3β and RhoA activities in AS-treated cells involved Akt signaling. Moreover, when using GW441756, a specific tropomyosin receptor kinase A (TrkA) receptor signaling inhibitor, the ERK1/2 and Akt phosphorylation, the inhibitory effects on GSK3β and RhoA and the neurite outgrowth induced by AS, but not AA, were totally suppressed. In conclusion, our findings supported the different upstream regulators of AS and AA in promoting neuritogenicity in Neuro-2a cells. Although both AS and AA could enhance neurite elongation through the suppression of GSK3β and RhoA activities, only AS could modulate the effect through TrkA receptor signaling.",English,24,3,6603103743,"['56516967100', '36955271500', '6603103743']",['2800'],"['asiatic acid', 'asiaticoside', 'neuritogenicity', 'TrkA receptor']","['Animals', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cyclic AMP Response Element-Binding Protein', 'Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3 beta', 'Mice', 'Neuronal Outgrowth', 'Neurons', 'Phosphorylation', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt', 'Receptor, trkA', 'rhoA GTP-Binding Protein', 'Signal Transduction', 'Triterpenes']","['2800', 'NEUR']",Chulalongkorn University
201900026,Application of pivoting adversarial networks in search for four top quark production in CMS,16/12/2019,"© Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.One burden of high energy physics data analysis is uncertainty within the measurement, both systematically and statistically. Even with sophisticated neural network techniques that are used to assist in high energy physics measurements, the resulting measurement may suffer from both types of uncertainties. Fortunately, most types of systematic uncertainties are based on knowledge from information such as theoretical assumptions, for which the range and behaviour are known. It has been proposed to mitigate such systematic uncertainties by using a new type of neural network called adversarial neural network (ANN) that would make the discriminator less sensitive to these uncertainties, but this has not yet been demonstrated in a real-life LHC analysis. This work investigates ANNs using as a benchmark the search for the production of four top quarks, an extremely rare physics process at the LHC and one of the important processes that can prove or disprove the Standard Model. The search for four top quarks in some cases is sensitive to large systematic uncertainties. The expected cross section upper limit for four top quark production is calculated using traditional neural networks and adversarial neural networks based on simulated proton-proton collisions within the Compact Muon Solenoid detector within Large Hadron Collider, and are compared to existing results. The improvement and further considerations to the search for rare processes at the LHC will be discussed.",English,5,0,57205302777,"['57205302777', '57219170016', '35226999000']",['3100'],,"['Adversarial networks', 'Compact Muon solenoids', 'Large Hadron Collider', 'Neural network techniques', 'Neural networks (ANN)', 'Proton proton collisions', 'Systematic uncertainties', 'The standard model']","['704.1', '922.1', '931.3', '902', '3100', 'PHYS']",Chulalongkorn University

201900028,Effects of few optical cycles approximation to spectral broadening generated in two-zero dispersion wavelengths fibers,16/12/2019,"© Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.It is both experimentally and numerically confirmed that Supercontinuum can be generated by pumping a few-tens-femtoseconds short pulse in anomalous dispersion region of a two zero-dispersion wavelengths (ZDW) fiber, such as, photonic crystal fiber. In numerical method, a well-known slowly varying envelope approximation (SVEA) has always been used to illustrate how the short pulse expands to a broadband spectrum in two-ZDWs fiber. But, the limit of SVEA is that it can only be applied for the short pulse, which its temporal envelope changes slowly comparing with its optical cycle. However, a few optical cycles short pulse is not fit with the condition of the SVEA approximation. In this report, another model, namely slowly evolving wave approximation (SEWA), is applied for numerical demonstration of supercontinuum generated by pumping the few optical cycles short pulse in two-ZDWs fiber. According to our simulation, under SEWA the final spectral width of the very short input pulse in the two-ZDWs fiber is between about 500-2000 nm, even the center wavelength of input pulse is near second-ZDW of fiber. Moreover, other effects of these two approximations since the center wavelength of the very short input pulse is close to both upper and lower ZDWs of the fiber in the same fiber's length are also compared in our presentation.",English,6,0,8894620100,"['57213520120', '57213518298', '8894620100', '57205297190']",['3100'],,"['Anomalous dispersion', 'Broad-band spectrum', 'Center wavelength', 'Slowly varying envelope approximation', 'Spectral broadening', 'Temporal envelopes', 'Wave approximation', 'Zero-dispersion wavelength']","['741.1.1', '921.6', '951', '902', '3100', 'PHYS']",Chulalongkorn University

We found that the Kosterlitz-Thouless (KT) transition corresponding to the rotational U(1) symmetry breaking and the Ising-like (I) transition corresponding to the reflection Z 2 symmetry breaking occur at two-separate transition temperatures, Tkt < TI . These temperatures lie close to each other, however in our results the separation is obvious. Our results show the order parameters as a function of temperature and we also estimate the critical exponents, β, , γ, η and ν.

201900030,Charged fermion in two-dimensional curved spaces of constant Gaussian curvature with constant magnetic flux,16/12/2019,"© Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.We investigate the behavior of spin-1/2 particles (electron and positron) confined to the Gaussian curvature surfaces. For the non-negative Gaussian curvatures, we present the preliminary results in cylindrical and spherical cases. To be specific we use the deformed hyperbolic solutions to obtain eigenvalues of the Dirac equation in the presence of an axial gauge field. Our results demonstrate the quantized energy and eigenstates of fermion. The quantization of energy depends on the spin-orbit coupling and the Landau quantization. The imaginary energy is obtained from the negative Gaussian curvatures. It is interpreted as the quasi normal mode (QNM). The angular momentum of fermion is shifted by addition of the constant magnetic flux. The fermion behaves like boson when the flux is half-integer.",English,41,1,57210338316,['57210338316'],['3100'],,"['Charged fermions', 'Dirac equations', 'Gaussian curvatures', 'Hyperbolic solution', 'Landau quantization', 'Quantization of energy', 'Quantized energies', 'Spin-orbit couplings']","['701.2', '922.1', '902', '3100', 'PHYS']",Chulalongkorn University
201900031,Comparison of electron temperature in DC glow discharge and AC glow discharge plasma,16/12/2019,"© Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.Knowing electron temperature and electron density is important for any plasma related applications. In this research, the electron temperature and electron density of argon plasma generated by low frequency AC power supply and a high voltage DC power supply were investigated. The measurements were compared, both experimentally and theoretically. For the experiment, a long glass cylindrical tube was used as a chamber where the electrodes were placed at 37.5 cm apart. A high voltage function generator power supply was operated at various frequencies and it was also used for DC operation. The electron temperatures were measured by Optical Emission Spectroscopy (OES) technique for different operating pressures of 0.1 mbar, 0.6 mbar and 1.1 mbar. For the simulation, both plasma theory and finite element method were used to simulate dynamics of the plasma in the cylindrical setup. From the experiment, the range of breakdown voltage was found to be between 0.80 to 2.3 kV. The length of DC glow discharge dark regions of the plasma decreases due to increasing in both operating pressure and voltage. AC glow discharge shows positive charge and negative charge swing. From the DC discharge, the maximum value of electron temperature was found to be 0.810 eV and the minimum value was 0.610 eV under the operating pressure 0.1 and 0.6 mbar respectively. From AC glow discharge plasma, the maximum electron temperature was 0.907 eV and the minimum was 0.540 eV under operating pressure 0.1 and 1.1 mbar respectively. Collision loss between ions and electrons causes this variation in the results.",English,10,2,35281298700,"['35281298700', '6505745024', '8832479600']",['3100'],,"['AC power supplies', 'Cylindrical tubes', 'DC glow discharge', 'Glow discharge plasmas', 'High voltage DC power supplies', 'Operating pressure', 'Optical emission spectroscopies (OES)', 'Positive charges']","['701.1', '706.1.1', '932.3', '941.4', '902', '3100', 'PHYS']",Navamindradhiraj University
201900032,An array of coupled nonlinear oscillators as a model for amplitude variations in intermodulation distortions from the auditory system,16/12/2019,"© Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.The response of a nonlinear oscillator driven by two or more forces displays several frequency components corresponding to the linear combinations of the driving frequencies, known as intermodulation distortions (IMDs). The auditory system of all classes of vertebrates produces strong IMDs in the presence of sounds of two tones. This phenomenon is attributed to the nonlinearity of the biological acoustic sensors within the inner ear. In this work, we developed a numerical model to investigate the total IMDs generated by a chain of coupled nonlinear oscillators. Total nonlinear distortions exhibited variations in amplitudes with respect to the stimulus frequency. The variation profile was sensitive to the magnitude of the driving forces and the difference in the two driving frequencies. We found that the arrangement of the oscillators' characteristic frequencies was necessary for the variations in total IMD level. Results from the numerical model agreed with measurements of IMDs from Chinese edible frog (Hoplobatrachus Rugulosus), whose inner ear is constituted by arrays of acoustic receptors with progressively increasing natural frequencies. In response to sounds of two tones, IMDs produced by the inner ear of Chinese edible frog exhibited variations in amplitudes with respect to the driving frequencies. The third-order distortion level displayed several peaks at high stimulating sound pressure level, and at large differences between the stimulus frequencies. Our findings suggest that an array of coupled nonlinear oscillator can serve as a simple model for the generation of nonlinear distortions by the inner ear.",English,5,0,49864480500,"['57213518921', '15925487500', '57213520327', '49864480500']",['3100'],,"['Amplitude variations', 'Characteristic frequencies', 'Coupled nonlinear oscillators', 'Frequency components', 'Linear combinations', 'Non-linear oscillators', 'Sound pressure level', 'Third-order distortion']","['601.1', '716.1', '921', '902', '3100', 'PHYS']",Chulalongkorn University Phyathai Rd.

201900034,Effects of anti-solvent in the two-step fabrication of absorber layer in perovskite solar cells,16/12/2019,"© Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.Hybrid organic-inorganic perovskite materials, e.g., CH3NH3PbI3 (MAPbI3) have been used as photon absorber layer in the emerging solar cell technology. The two-step spin coating technique has been employed to fabricate the absorber films. It has been found that the use of anti-solvents plays a crucial role on the growth of the perovskite crystals. Chlorobenzene (CB) and Toluene (TO) were chosen as the anti-solvents that were applied after spin-coating of Methylammonium Iodide (MAI) solution in the second step of the two-step process. The amount and the elapsed time of the application of anti-solvents after spinning MAI solution were varied and studied for the crystal growth of perovskite films as well as the performance of the perovskite solar cells (PSCs). It was found that 50 ml of CB applied at 5 s after spinning MAI solution yielded the best solar cells parameters with the best efficiency of 16.8 %.",English,15,0,6602752940,"['57213519220', '16176612100', '6602752940']",['3100'],,"['Absorber films', 'Absorber layers', 'Hybrid organic-inorganic', 'Perovskite crystal', 'Perovskite films', 'Photon absorbers', 'Solar cell technology', 'Two-step process']","['482.2', '803', '813.2', '902', '3100', 'PHYS']",Chulalongkorn University Phyathai Rd.
201900035,Simulation of phase-ordering dynamics of 2d Ising model under influence of oscillatory shear,16/12/2019,"© Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.In this paper, we study phase-ordering dynamics of 2d Ising model under influence of oscillatory shear by computer simulation. We focus on the time evolution of the equal-time correlation functions to test the dynamical scaling hypothesis and to determine the governing growth laws. We find that at late times the system has two different behaviours which are a non-shear behaviour and a uniformly sheared behaviour. Initial phases and frequencies of oscillatory shear determine the behaviour of the system. On one hand, if the frequency is high, the system behaves as if it is not under shear. On the other hand, if the frequency is approached zero, the behaviour of the system will be determined by the initial phase of oscillatory shear. At the initial phase of 90 degree (or 270 degree), the system also behaves as if it is not under shear. Otherwise, the system behaves as if it is under uniform shear (Oscillatory shear is in the form of cosine function).",English,9,0,,"['57213519837', '57189296348']",['3100'],,"['Cosine functions', 'Dynamical scaling', 'Initial phasis', 'Oscillatory shear', 'Phase ordering dynamics', 'Shear behaviour', 'Time correlation functions', 'Time evolutions']","['921.3', '922', '902', '3100', 'PHYS']",
201900036,Extracting overlapping 2D-images by central-derivatives-based algorithm,16/12/2019,"© Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.Usual algorithms, such as, 5-steps and a backward-derivatives-based (BDB) method, could extract an image of a top layer from a one of a base layer in a 2D full-field optical coherent tomography (FFOCT). Those both algorithms still give the robust images. For improving the quality of the image in 2D-FFOCT, in this research a central-derivatives-based (CDB) algorithm is introduced to apply for investigating two overlapping 2D images. According to our simulation, it shows that the performance of CDB-algorithm is as good as the one of 5-step algorithm in case a phase difference between each fringe images is not more than 40 degree. It is also less robust by comparing with the one of BDB-algorithm. By our experimental results, it can also be concluded that the CDB-algorithm can separate two overlapping 2D images with more brightness than the ones applied by BDB-algorithm.",English,6,0,57205297190,"['57213521360', '57213519744', '8894620100', '57205297190']",['3100'],,"['2D images', 'Base layers', 'Fringe images', 'Optical coherent tomography', 'Phase difference', 'Top layers']","['902', '3100', 'PHYS']",Chulalongkorn University

The persistence exponents which describe the decay of the persistence probabilities, the probabilities of the average of all initial height (h 0), are increased as l is increased for all models. The results of one-dimensional Family ((1+1)-Family) and Das Sarma-Tamborenea ((1+1)-DT) models with kinetically rough film surface show the decrease of the growth exponent (β) with l. The l>1 results preserve the relation. In contrast, β is observed to increase with l for the two-dimensional larger curvature ((2+1)-LC) and Wolf-Villain ((2+1)-WV) models with mounded morphology. Our results show that the relation is not valid in l>1 cases in models with mounded surfaces.

201900038,Performance of cytokine models in predicting SLE activity,16/12/2019,"© 2019 The Author(s).Background: Identification of universal biomarkers to predict systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) flares is challenging due to the heterogeneity of the disease. Several biomarkers have been reported. However, the data of validated biomarkers to use as a predictor for lupus flares show variation. This study aimed to identify the biomarkers that are sensitive and specific to predict lupus flares. Methods: One hundred and twenty-four SLE patients enrolled in this study and were prospectively followed up. The evaluation of disease activity achieved by the SLE disease activity index (SLEDAI-2K) and clinical SLEDAI (modified SLEDAI). Patients with active SLE were categorized into renal or non-renal flares. Serum cytokines were measured by multiplex bead-based flow cytometry. The correlation and logistic regression analysis were performed. Results: Levels of IFN-α, MCP-1, IL-6, IL-8, and IL-18 significantly increased in active SLE and correlated with clinical SLEDAI. Complement C3 showed a weakly negative relationship with IFN-α and IL-18. IL-18 showed the highest positive likelihood ratios for active SLE. Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that IL-6, IL-8, and IL-18 significantly increased odds ratio (OR) for active SLE at baseline while complement C3 and IL-18 increased OR for active SLE at 12 weeks. IL-18 and IL-6 yielded higher sensitivity and specificity than anti-dsDNA and C3 to predict active renal and active non-renal, respectively. Conclusion: The heterogeneity of SLE pathogenesis leads to different signaling mechanisms and mediates through several cytokines. The monitoring of cytokines increases the sensitivity and specificity to determine SLE disease activity. IL-18 predicts the risk of active renal SLE while IL-6 and IL-8 predict the risk of active non-renal. The sensitivity and specificity of these cytokines are higher than the anti-dsDNA or C3.

201900039,Availability of emergency obstetric and newborn care services at public health facilities of Sindh province in Pakistan,16/12/2019,"© 2019 The Author(s).Background: Basic and comprehensive emergency obstetric care services in Pakistan remain a challenge considering continued high burden of maternal and newborn mortality. This study aimed to assess the availability of emergency obstetric and newborn care in Sindh Province of Pakistan. Methods: This cross-sectional survey was conducted in twelve districts of the Sindh province in Pakistan. The districts were selected based on the maternal neonatal and child health indicators. Data were collected from 63 public-sector health facilities including district, Taluka (subdistrict) headquarters hospitals and rural health centers. Basic and comprehensive emergency obstetric newborn care services were assessed through direct observations and interviews with the heads of the health facilities by using a World Health Organization pretested and validated data collection tool. Participants interviewed in this study included the managers and auxiliary staff and in health facilities. Results: Availability of caesarean section (23, 95% C.I. 14.0-35.0) and blood transfusion services (57, 95% CI. 44.0-68.0), the two components of comprehensive emergency obstetric and newborn care, was poor in our study. However, assessment of the seven components of basic emergency obstetric and newborn services showed that 92% of the health facilities (95% C.I. 88.0-96.0) had parenteral antibiotics, 90%, (95% C.I. 80.0-95.0) had oxytocin, 92% (95% CI 88.0-96.0) had manual removal of the placenta service, 87% (95%, C.I. 76.0-93.0) of the facilities had staff who could remove retained products of conception, 82% (95% C.I. 71.0-89.0) had facilities for normal birth and 80% (95% C.I. 69.0-88.0) reported presence of neonatal resuscitation service. Conclusion: Though the basic obstetric and newborn services were reasonably available, comprehensive obstetric and newborn services were not available as per the World Health Organization's standards in the surveyed public health facilities. Ensuring the availability of caesarean section and blood transfusion services within these facilities may improve population's access to these essential services around birth.",English,27,6,57129461700,"['57129461700', '57193011774', '55433606700', '6505769005']",['2719'],"['Basic and comprehensive emergency obstetric and newborn care', 'Maternal health', 'Newborn care']","['Child Health Services', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Delivery, Obstetric', 'Emergency Medical Services', 'Emergency Treatment', 'Female', 'Health Facilities', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Humans', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Maternal Health Services', 'Pakistan', 'Pregnancy']","['2719', 'MEDI']",Health Services Academy
201900040,"The impact of National Health Insurance upon accessibility of health services and financial protection from catastrophic health expenditure: A case study of Savannakhet province, the Lao People's Democratic Republic",16/12/2019,"© 2019 The Author(s).Introduction: Many schemes have been implemented by the government of the Lao People's Democratic Republic to provide equity in health service utilisation. Initially, health service utilisations were fully supported by the government and were subsequently followed by the Revolving Drug Fund. In the 2000s, four health financing schemes, namely the Social Security Organization, the State Authority for Social Security, the Health Equity Fund and Community-Based Health Insurance (CBHI), were introduced with various target groups. However, as these voluntary schemes have suffered from a very low enrolment rate, the government decided to pilot the National Health Insurance (NHI) scheme, which offers a flat, co-payment system for health service utilisation. This study aims to assess the effectiveness of the NHI in terms of its accessibility and in providing financial protection from catastrophic health expenditure. Methods: The data collection process was implemented in hospitals of two districts of Savannakhet province. A structured questionnaire was used to retrieve all required information from 342 households; the information comprised of the socioeconomics of the household, accessibility to health services and financial payment for both outpatient and inpatient department services. Binary logistic regression models were used to discover the impact of NHI in terms of accessibility and financial protection. The impact of NHI was then compared with the outcomes of the preceding, voluntary CBHI scheme, which had been the subject of earlier studies. Results: Under the NHI, it was found that married respondents, large households and the level of income significantly increased the probability of accessibility to health service utilisation. Most importantly, NHI significantly improved accessibility for the poorest income quantile. In terms of financial protection, households with an existing chronic condition had a significantly higher chance of suffering financial catastrophe when compared to households with healthy members. As probability of catastrophic expenditure was not affected by income level, it was indicated that NHI is able to provide equity in financial protection. Conclusion: The models found that the NHI significantly enhances accessibility for poor income households, improving health service distribution and accessibility for the various income levels when compared to the CBHI coverage. Additionally, it was also found that NHI had enhanced financial protection since its introduction. However, the NHI policy requires a dramatically high level of government subsidy; therefore, there its long-term sustainability remains to be determined.",English,42,5,57193741126,"['57193741126', '6506044883']",['2719'],"['Accessibility to health services', 'catastrophic health expenditure', 'Community-Based Health Insurance', 'financial protection', 'health policy', 'health services', 'hospitalisation', ""Laos People's Democratic Republic"", 'National Health Insurance']","['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Female', 'Financing, Personal', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Humans', 'Laos', 'Logistic Models', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'National Health Programs', 'Residence Characteristics', 'Socioeconomic Factors', 'Young Adult']","['2719', 'MEDI']",Chulalongkorn University

Published by Oxford University Press. All rights reserved. For permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.com.Identification of the amino-acid motifs in proteins that are targeted for post-translational modifications (PTMs) is of great importance in understanding regulatory networks. Information about targeted motifs can be derived from mass spectrometry data that identify peptides containing specific PTMs such as phosphorylation, ubiquitylation and acetylation. Comparison of input data against a standardized 'background' set allows identification of over-and under-represented amino acids surrounding the modified site. Conventionally, calculation of targeted motifs assumes a random background distribution of amino acids surrounding the modified position. However, we show that probabilities of amino acids depend on (i) the type of the modification and (ii) their positions relative to the modified site. Thus, software that identifies such over-and under-represented amino acids should make appropriate adjustments for these effects. Here we present a new program, PTM-Logo, that generates representations of these amino acid preferences ('logos') based on position-specific amino-acid probability backgrounds calculated either from user-input data or curated databases.",English,11,7,35478273500,"['35073059200', '55175523500', '8234924200', '55662206500', '6507719425', '35478273500', '6507728111']","['2613', '1303', '1312', '1706', '1703', '2605']",,"['Amino Acids', 'Position-Specific Scoring Matrices', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational', 'Proteins', 'Software']","['2613', '1303', '1312', '1706', '1703', '2605', 'MATH', 'BIOC', 'COMP']",National Institutes of Health

Published by Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.There are limited data on infants with HIV starting antiretroviral therapy (ART) in the neonatal period. We investigated the association between the timing of ART initiation and time-to-suppression among infants who tested HIV-positive and initiated ART within the first 28 days of life. The effect was estimated using cumulative probability flexible parametric spline models and a multivariable generalized additive mixed model was performed to test nonlinear associations. Forty-four neonates were included. Nineteen (43.2%) initiated ART within 7 days of life and 25 (56.8%) from 8 to 28 days. Infants treated within 7 days were 4-fold more likely to suppress earlier than those treated after 7 days [Hazard ratio (HR) 4.01 (1.7-9.5)]. For each week the ART initiation was delayed, the probability of suppression decreased by 35% (HR 0.65 [0.46-0.92]). Age at ART start was linearly associated with time-to-suppression. However, a linear association with normally distributed residuals was not found between baseline viral load and time-to-suppression, with no association found when baseline viral loads were ≤5 log(10) copies/mL, but with exponential increase in time-to-suppression with > log5 copies/mL at baseline.

Published by Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.Background:Perinatally HIV-infected adolescents (PHIVA) are an expanding population vulnerable to loss to follow-up (LTFU). Understanding the epidemiology and factors for LTFU is complicated by varying LTFU definitions.Setting:Asian regional cohort incorporating 16 pediatric HIV services across 6 countries.Methods:Data from PHIVA (aged 10-19 years) who received combination antiretroviral therapy 2007-2016 were used to analyze LTFU through (1) an International epidemiology Databases to Evaluate AIDS (IeDEA) method that determined LTFU as >90 days late for an estimated next scheduled appointment without returning to care and (2) the absence of patient-level data for >365 days before the last data transfer from clinic sites. Descriptive analyses and competing-risk survival and regression analyses were used to evaluate LTFU epidemiology and associated factors when analyzed using each method.Results:Of 3509 included PHIVA, 275 (7.8%) met IeDEA and 149 (4.3%) met 365-day absence LTFU criteria. Cumulative incidence of LTFU was 19.9% and 11.8% using IeDEA and 365-day absence criteria, respectively. Risk factors for LTFU across both criteria included the following: age at combination antiretroviral therapy initiation <5 years compared with age ≥5 years, rural clinic settings compared with urban clinic settings, and high viral loads compared with undetectable viral loads. Age 10-14 years compared with age 15-19 years was another risk factor identified using 365-day absence criteria but not IeDEA LTFU criteria.Conclusions:Between 12% and 20% of PHIVA were determined LTFU with treatment fatigue and rural treatment settings consistent risk factors.

The study area was Dang-Yai subdistrict, Baan Mai Chaiyapot district, Buriram province, Thailand. The sampling of particulate matter of less than 10 μm (PM10) was performed from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. each day between 14th and 18th December 2015 inclusively. The PM10 was collected on a glass fiber filter using a nylon cyclone connected to a personal air pump with an air flow rate of 1.7 L/min. The samples were extracted by a microwave digester, and the metals were analyzed by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry. The average exposure concentrations of the workers to Cd, Cu, Ni and Pb were 0.0073 ± 0.0084, 0.2083 ± 0.6362, 0.3499 ± 0.3738 and 0.1297 ± 0.1746 μg/m3, respectively.

Furthermore, the lipid extracted residue obtained from two different algal biomass such as Chlorella sp. and Sargassum sp. were explored for biochar production through a slow pyrolysis technique at 400 °C. The hematite iron ore reduction with algal biochar was performed non-isothermally at 1100 °C under nitrogen atmosphere. The metallic iron synthesis from hematite iron ore involves three major steps, and they were as follows (1) in this step the Fe3O4 was synthesized from Fe2O3 at the temperature of 350–450 °C; (2) this step contain the formation of FeO from Fe3O4 at the temperature of 700–850 °C; (3) finally the formation of metallic iron (Fe) was observed at higher temperature of 850–1100 °C. Herein, we established a novel low-cost microalgae-based biorefinery approach for the production of bioenergy and residue for metallic iron production from municipal waste.",English,68,39,21734976900,"['54395089600', '57200873137', '55355146400', '7202418804', '57117662400', '21734976900']","['2205', '2215', '2611', '2105', '2103', '2102', '2310', '2100', '2210', '2209', '2308', '2208']","['Biodiesel', 'Metallic iron conversion', 'Microalgae Chlorella sp.', 'municipal sewage', 'Seaweed Sargassum']","['Biodiesel production', 'Biofuel production', 'Biomass productions', 'Chlorella sp', 'Extracted residue', 'Metallic iron', 'Municipal sewage', 'Nitrogen atmospheres']","['452.1', '461.9', '482.2', '504.3', '523', '533.1', '902', '2205', '2215', '2611', '2105', '2103', '2102', '2310', '2100', '2210', '2209', '2308', '2208', 'ENGI', 'MATH', 'ENER', 'ENVI']",Chulalongkorn University
201900048,Ordered mesoporous Ni/La2O3 catalysts with interfacial synergism towards CO2 activation in dry reforming of methane,15/12/2019,"© 2019 Elsevier B.V.This paper describes the synthesis of ordered mesoporous Ni/La2O3 catalysts (denoted as Ni/La2O3-m) for dry reforming of methane and investigates the synergistic effect of Ni/La2O3 interfaces on the activation of CO2. The resultant nanostructured La2O3 possessed high specific surface area of 211.5 m2/g, and Ni/La2O3-m catalysts maintained the initial morphology upon thermal treatment. The mesostructure was beneﬁcial to obtain and maintain Ni nanoparticles with sizes between 4–6 nm. Ni/La2O3-m catalysts exhibited superior activity and stability in dry reforming of methane, showing excellent performance in activating both CH4 and CO2 due to more catalytically active Ni sites and increased interfaces. In situ DRIFTS indicated that bidentate carbonate participates in coke elimination. Combined with CO2-TPD and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we found that Ni/La2O3-m catalyst has stronger capability to promote the formation of bidentate carbonate due to the increased interfaces by enhancing Ni dispersion, which leads to better stability by suppressing the coke deposition.",English,72,81,55218059900,"['56652826600', '57205189313', '55676494900', '56602268200', '57194281052', '57188997228', '7004487886', '55581072000', '36005591000', '55218059900']","['1503', '2300', '1508']","['Bidentate carbonate', 'CO2activation', 'Mesoporous La2O3', 'Metal support interface', 'Monodentate carbonate']","['Bidentate carbonates', 'CO2 activation', 'Mesoporous', 'Metal-support interfaces', 'Monodentates']","['524', '548.1', '802.2', '804', '922.1', '951', '902', '1503', '2300', '1508', 'CENG', 'ENVI']",Tianjin University
201900049,Heterogeneous structural defects to prompt charge shuttle in g-C3N4 plane for boosting visible-light photocatalytic activity,15/12/2019,"© 2019 Elsevier B.V.Structural defect engineering toward g-C3N4 plane usually has great benefit on modulating electron structure and photocatalytic performance. Here, we report a porous g-C3N4 material with heterogeneous structural defects, oxygen atom replacing edge nitrogen and cyano group, obtained via a facile treatment method. The reconstructed material shows narrowing band gap, high light absorption and fast charge separation. Theoretical calculation discloses that the doped oxygen atom and the nearby atoms accept electrons as reduction site to produce hydrogen, while the undoped fraction and cyano group take the duty to oxidize water. The delocalization of reactive sites drives charge shuttle on the plane, limiting recombination of charge carriers. Consequently, the modified g-C3N4 shows excellent photocatalytic activity with apparent quantum efficiency of 8.41% under 420 nm wavelength, surpassing pure g-C3N4 and other reported materials with defect compilation. We think that this work provides a new avenue to understand the function of structural defect on prompt charge separation.",English,39,83,18936731800,"['57191251866', '57195574483', '18936731800', '35756736500', '58068423900', '56365395900']","['1503', '2300', '1508']","['Charge shuttle', 'g-C3N4', 'Heterogeneous structural defects', 'Hydrogen production', 'Photocatalyst']","['Charge shuttles', 'Electron structures', 'Excellent photocatalytic activities', 'g-C3N4', 'Photocatalytic performance', 'Structural defect', 'Theoretical calculations', 'Visible light photocatalytic activity']","['522', '712.1', '741.1', '803', '804', '931.3', '951', '902', '1503', '2300', '1508', 'CENG', 'ENVI']",Chulalongkorn University
